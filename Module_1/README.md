# Grading System
This Solidity implementation shows off the fundamental syntax and features of the Solidity programming language. It is a straightforward grading system. This program is meant to be a jumping off point for anyone who are unfamiliar with Solidity and wish to acquire a sense of how it functions.
## Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows setting and retrieving student grades, and checking if a student has passed or failed. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started
### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

To compile the code,click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to 0.8.17 (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile GradingSystem.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "GradingSystem" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the functions provided. For example, you can set a grade, retrieve a grade, and check if a student has passed or failed.
