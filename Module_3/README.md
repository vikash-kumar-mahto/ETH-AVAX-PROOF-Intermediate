After executing these steps you will now be able to use the program. You can check your total supply by clicking on the total supply variable and expanding its call in the terminal.
You will be looking at the decoded output variable to see the value of the total supply variable.
You can use the mint, transfer, and burn functions by placing an address, and an unsigned integer value as value in the function then clicking the transact button. However, only the owner can use the mint function.


## Help

Be sure to compile before deploying VikashToken.sol </br>
Be sure to select AvaToken.sol as the contract before deploying </br>
Only the owner can use the mint function </br>
You can use different accounts by expanding the account section under deploy and run transactions tab
